# All-in-one-calculator-with-Python

This is a WIP of a calculator made entirely with Python. The long-term goal of this program is to use it in a raspberry Pi in order to make our own portable calculator.
The idea is to include as many features as possible, from simple arithmetic calculations to formula solvers and graph drawings.
Currently, the program features only a few functions, but more are to be added soon!
