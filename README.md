# All-in-one-calculator-with-Python
A work-in-progress calculator made entirely with Python.

Goals
- Aims in long-term goal to be deployable to raspberry Pi, such that it can be considered a portable calculator.
- Aims to be feature rich, from simple arithmetic calculations to formula solvers and graph drawings. Currently, the program features only a few functions, but more are to be added soon!
